# Flux.NewRelic
The goal of this project is to manage the release done by Flux in the Cluster by receiving WebHook post from the notification controller. 

**Why is the project in C# or even Dotnet and not in GO?** Just because... it could even be in F# if I wanted to. I just went with something quick to build. Probably in the future I will look forward to change the language and even the structure of the project.
